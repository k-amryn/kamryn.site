## Ergonomics

Ergonomics is the measure of how compatible something is with our natural ways of operating. When trying to communicate [novel ideas](vibes) or values to people, it is necessary to design an "interface" for your ideas to maximize their bioavailability.

Optimizing for ergonomics is also necessary to ensure [durability](durability) of your ideas. If your ideas can only be digested by a niche group of people, then they lose potential [network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) and potentially face extinction. Ideas need to be able to reproduce to stay alive.
