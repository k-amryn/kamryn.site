## Vibes

I define vibes as feelings that can't be easily categorized under any common emotional category. They are feelings of something "lighting up" that happen when certain factors are met.

I believe the [durability](durability) test for vibes is whether they can be felt by people who are not part of the specific vibe's culture with sufficient briefing on the factors of the vibe.
